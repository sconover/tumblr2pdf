		"quote-text":"&#8220;<p>one of the most well-known conservative commentators in the world said to me privately in Chicago. I won&#8217;t report the name of the individual, but he\/she said:<\/p>\n\n<p>&#8220;What are we to think of McCain&#8217;s choice of Palin? It&#8217;s outrageous &#8212; an insult to the nation and an insult to everything the man has supposedly stood for all his life.<\/p>\n\n<p>McCain&#8217;s decision is right up there in the history books &#8212; right up there with Caligula appointing his horse to the Senate.<\/p>\n\n<p>No self-respecting conservative can support McCain now.&#8221;<br\/>\n&#8230;<br\/>\nI offer this comment from a well-known conservative personality as a benchmark of the anger out there in Bush Land about John McCain.<\/p>&#8221;",
