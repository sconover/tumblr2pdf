needs to be a book I can use.  I want to use.  It's a reference.  
It should be like the Chicago Manual of Style.  I want to pull it off the self and use it,
because it's functional and nice to look at.
  - front to back - by time
  - black squares on the side of the page that line up per month, and say in nice helvetica "Oct 2007"
    ....so you can "see" where the months change.
  - what about a mini-calendar with the day marked?  would have to be really subtle and stylish.

     ...as I flip I see the dates advance, like a flipbook animation.
  - generate an index based on search keywords (cmd line option?)
    ...and make a month "front page" based on this?
      ...month front page: tagcloud?  or one of those other cool tagcloudy things.
  - apply your own css like tumblr lets you do - you can override anything.  
    ...or there's a default css file.  you can just take that and change it.
